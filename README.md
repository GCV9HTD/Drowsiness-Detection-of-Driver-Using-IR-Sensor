# Drowsiness-Detection-of-Driver-Using-IR-Sensor
Wearable specs designed with a sensor that can sense the difference of eye open/close state and Ardduino MCU has been programmed to make the decision of drowsiness.
Sensors are positioned in such a way that it can detect the movement of eye and calibrated for status recognition.
